\noindent\textbf{Title: Replace Subconn 8-contact ethernet bulkhead with 13-contact bulkhead.}

\subsection*{Technical Description:}

%  TrendNet TP-IV343PI

The original \mascot\ design specified an 8-contact Subconn
ethernet bulkhead connector (Figure \ref{fig:subconn8})
as the only wet connection to the \mascot\ camera enclosure.   This
connector was selected in part because it allowed reuse of the three existing
Subconn/Falmat gigabit ethernet cables originally purchased for
Sexton subsea cameras owned by the Stewart lab.  The
\mascot\ design replicated the physical interface of those cameras, with the
8-pin connector on the web camera unit providing both gigabit ethernet and
802.3af/at Power over Ethernet (PoE) over a single 8-conductor twisted pair
Cat-6 cable (Falmat XtremeNet P/N FM022208-08).

The Sexton subsea cameras consume approximately 7.7 W.   The 802.3af standard allows for 15.4 W of DC power
at the injector end (less at the device end due to $I^2R$ losses in the cable), while the 802.3at extends this to 25.5 watts.
The estimated power budget of \mascot\ is 46W: 14W for the Jetson TX mainboard,  2W
for the SATA SSD and Zed camera, and 15W for each of the two BlueRobotics lights at full brightness.
These approximate values were subsequently validated with bench testing, although the
consumption of the Jetson TX1 is highly variable with computational load.

To accommodate this increased power requirement, \mascot\ was designed around a
non-standard 60W PoE injector/splitter pair.    High-power PoE systems, while
not compliant with an existing IEEE standard, are increasingly available from
wireless manufacturers as they accommodate the power requirements of extended
range, multi-band and multi-radio/MIMO enterprise wireless WLAN systems. The
splitter installed in \mascot\ includes power regulation to 19VDC which can be
accepted natively by both the Jetson TX1 and the BlueRobotics lights.  The PoE
system has limited surge capacity and it was possible to reboot the Jetson TX1
by turning both lights on suddenly, but implementing a smoothly ramping
turn-on/turn-off procedure in the companion board resolved this problem.

Under testing, it was determined that two BlueRobotics lights at a nominal 1500
lumens apiece produced insufficient light for many in-water testing scenarios,
resulting in low contrast and blurring in the video images (Figure \ref{fig:pool_testing}).   The simplest
solution would be to add additional lights.  As the BlueRobotics lights are
inexpensive and compact, four more light units could be added trivially to the
existing \mascot\ package.   Doing so, however would exceed the power capacity
of of the PoE-based power system.

\end{figure}


The proposal is to replace the 8-contact ethernet-only penetrator (Figure \ref{fig:subconn8}) with a 13-pin penetrator
(Figure \ref{fig:subconn13}) which adds
four additional conductors (and a shield connection) to the eight ethernet pins.
The additional pins (at
4A nom each) can then used as an independent power bus.   Notably, this
connector is also used on the Adaptive Monitoring Package (AMP) and TUNA WEBS for
similar purposes (ethernet plus power).

The final configuration will have six
BlueRobotics LED lights, with a nominal power budget of  $\sim105W$.   The power
conductors will supply 2.1A at 48VDC nom. from the topside.   The BlueRobotics lights
will take up to 48V (less cable losses) directly, but the Jetson requires
a DC/DC converter to generate 9-18VDC.   The addition of the DC/DC converter
also provides some amount of power bus isolation between the two units.

This would necessitate the following changes:

\begin{itemize}

\item Replace the Subconn 8-contact DBH8M bulkhead with a 13-contact DBH13M
bulkhead.   The DBH8M is threaded into the aluminum \mascot\ endcap with a
7/16-20 UNF thread, while the DBH13M has a 1/2-20 UNF thread.
If the 7/16-UNF thread has been cut to spec, there should be sufficient material
left to re-drill and re-tap to 1/2-20.

\item Add four additional BlueRobotics LED lights, mounted adjacent to the
existing lights.   These additional lights will be daisy-chained to the current
lights using the daisy-chain penetrator provided by BlueRobotics.   This will
maintain the existing \mascot\ design of having two independent left-right light
banks, but will require no additional penetrations through the \mascot\ endcap.

As
the BlueRobotics penetrations are DIY, putting these penetrations in the light
units rather than into the main \mascot\ housing reduces the risk if they should
fail (water intrusion to light electronics rather than Jetson/Zed).   This is
contingent on being able to chain three lights together, which depends on the
current-carrying capacity of the BlueRobotics cabling.

\item Purchase of a new wet cable at $\sim50$ ft incorporating the 13-pin Subconn
connector.

\item Replace the PoE injector at topside with a deckbox which terminates
the wet cable into Gigabit ethernet (as a punchdown jack?) and power leads.
This deck box would incorporate the main power supply for \mascot, a 48V
150W+ AC-DC converter.

\item Replace the PoE splitter in \mascot\ with a 12V output,
30W DC/DC converter.     The proposed unit has a similar, if
slightly smaller physical envelope
than the existing PoE splitter.

\item Add fuses inside the enclosure for the two BlueRobotics light chains.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Change Request Impacts}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|X|}
\hline
  \textbf{Scope} &  As the first phase of \mascot\ development is complete, this change does not affect
the original SEG IRD project scope or schedule.  \\
\hline
  \textbf{Schedule} &  As above, this change is in response to the results of the original \mascot\ project,
and does not affect the schedule of the original \mascot\ project, which is in its
reporting phase.  Mechanical and electrical re-work can be performed on an as-available basis by
Robert Karran with support from the UW-APL machine shop.
\\
\hline

  \textbf{Cost} & The known expenses for a new bulkhead, wet cabling, etc. are
  well known and fit within the contingency remaining in the \mascot\ budget. If
  the existing aluminum endcap cannot easily be re-tapped for the larger
  penetrator, the costs for a new alu. endcap may exceed that contingency,
  making this change infeasible. \\

\hline
  \textbf{Quality} & Enables \mascot\ to produce better video images.
As the lights are dimmable, there is no risk of producing a light package
that is ``too bright.'' \\
\hline
  \textbf{Risk} & Mechanical risk from re-working and using the reworked alu. endcap.
 Increasing the number of BlueRobotics light penetrations increases
 the opportunity for leaks, esp. with the
DIY BlueRobotics penetrations. \\
\hline
  \textbf{Alternatives:}  &  Power lights through independent, parallel power cable(s)?
This would require either a second penetration into
the \mascot\ housing or a wet splice of the power cabling to the lights.  \\
